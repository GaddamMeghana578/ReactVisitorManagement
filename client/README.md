ReactVisitorManagement
Visitor Mangement project uses the MERN stack technology for managing the visitors.

Description: Currently this application works in 2 modes.

• Visitor(Enroll)

• Administrator(Login)

Enroll: The visitor/user registers by entering all the necessary details and the badge is generated and printed(if required).

Login: This is mainly for the administrator mode. You need to enter the valid credentials in order to manage the enrolled visitors. Admin credentials are hardcoded for now(Username:"admin" and Password:12345)

Currently we are building the client of the application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
