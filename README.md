# React Visitor Management Tutorial

_MERN Stack Project_

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You are going to need **Node.js**, **MongoDB** and **npm** or **yarn** installed on your machine.
**Note**: You can either install **MongoDB** locally on your machine or use **MongoDB Atlas**
Make sure you are on latest version of node.

### Installing

How to properly install and configure this repository to work on your machine.

Cloning the repository

```
git clone ...
```

Enter cloned directory

```
cd ReactVisitorManagement/
```

Enter Server directory on another terminal

```
cd ReactVisitorManagement/server
```

Install the packages needed on the server using

```
ReactVisitorManagement/server/npm install
```

OR

```
ReactVisitorManagement/server/yarn install
```

Enter Client directory

```
cd ReactVisitorManagement/client
```

Install the packages needed on client using

```
ReactVisitorManagement/client/npm install
```

OR

```
ReactVisitorManagement/client/yarn install
```

Run the application on client

```
ReactVisitorManagement/client/npm start
```

OR

```
ReactVisitorManagement/client/yarn start
```

## Starting the repository on your machine

You will need to run client & server seperately, ports are already configured, make sure you don't conflict them if you change anything.

If you are not using **MongoDBAtlas** then do the below:

Start Mongo server in your project directory

```
cd VisitorRegistration
```

VisitorRegistration/mongod

```
On mac book you need to run

```

VisitorRegistration/sudo mongod

```

Run the server

```

ReactVisitorManagement/server/npm start

```
OR

```

ReactVisitorManagement/server/yarn start

```

Now you can see that **localhost:3000** automatically opens up on your browser and you can use the app
