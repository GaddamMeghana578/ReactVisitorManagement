## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Prerequisites

You are going to need **Node.js**, **MongoDB** and **npm** or **yarn** installed on your machine.
**Note**: You can either install **MongoDB** locally on your machine or use **MongoDB Atlas**

### Installing

Cloning the repository

```
git clone ...
```

Enter cloned directory

```
cd ReactVisitorManagement/
```
Enter Server directory and do npm install or yarn install

```
cd ReactVisitorManagement/server && npm install --save or yarn install --save
```
Enter Client directory and do npm install or yarn install

```
cd ReactVisitorManagement/client && npm install --save or yarn install --save
```

## Starting the repository on your machine

You will need to run client & server seperately, ports are already configured, make sure you don't conflict them if you change anything.

If you are not using **MongoDBAtlas** then do the below:

Start Mongo server in your project directory

```
cd VisitorRegistration && mongod
```
On mac book you need to run

```
cd VisitorRegistration && sudo mongod
```

Enter client directory and do npm start or yarn start

```
cd ReactVisitorManagement/client && npm start or yarn start
